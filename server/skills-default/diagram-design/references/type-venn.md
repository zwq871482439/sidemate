# Venn / Set Overlap

**Best for:** intersection of concepts/domains, shared attributes between categories, "where A meets B", ikigai-style frames (desirable × feasible × viable).

## Layout conventions
- **Prefer 2 or 3 circles.** Avoid 4+ (unreadable — use a matrix instead).
- Circle stroke: 1px hairline, color per-set (ink, muted, soft).
- Circle fill: very low-opacity tint — `rgba(15,43,70,0.04)` for ink set, `rgba(91,107,123,0.05)` for muted. Tints compound naturally in overlap regions.
- Radii: equal when sets are comparable in size; proportional when sets are meaningfully different. Don't fake equal sizes for aesthetics.
- **Set labels** placed outside the circle, NEVER crossing the stroke. Microsoft YaHei 12–14px 600 for the set name, optional Consolas 9px sublabel.
- **Intersection labels** placed inside the overlap region, Microsoft YaHei 12px 600, centered. For small overlaps, use a leader line to a label in clear space.
- **Coral accent** on the ONE focal intersection — the "sweet spot". Either coral label stroke OR clipPath-bounded coral fill tint (`rgba(232,181,77,0.10)`).
- Circle centers and radii divisible by 4.

## Anti-patterns
- Unlabeled regions — reader can't tell which set is which.
- Circles that don't overlap when overlap is the point.
- Equal-sized circles when sets are obviously different (dishonest).
- Coral on multiple overlap regions (focal signal dies).
- Labels sitting on top of circle strokes (illegible).
- 4+ circles where 2–3 would do.
